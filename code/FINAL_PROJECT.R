# Visualizing the distribution of the data
  hist(df_BN0$birds, breaks = 50, main = "Bird Observation Density Histogram", 
    xlab = "Bird Observation Density")
    # Breaks will be the number of bins of the histogram
  
  # We can already see the data is not distributed normally
  # It is skewed to the right (the tail is towards the right)

# Testing if the data is normally distributed
  # The shapiro-test only works with =< 5000 data points
  # The data frame has 6,500,000 points, too many for this test
  
  # An alternative is to measure the symmetry and taildness of the data
  # and see if the results are ones expected for a normal distribution
  # A normal distribution:
    # is symmetrical : skewness tends to 0, between -0.5 and 0.5 is considered good enough
    # Has a taildness which the kurtosis value is 3 
  
  
  # Measuring the skewness
  library(e1071)
  skewness(df_BN$birds2)
  # 1.551999 --> The data is skewed to the right (NOT normally distributed)
  
  # Measuring the taildness
  kurtosis(df_BN$birds2)
  # 4.147184 --> The data has a heavy tail 
  # (The tail extends slower than a normal distribution)
  
  # Conclusion : The data is NOT normally distributed 
  # (As expected when visualizing the histogram)

# Creating groups of data distinguised by their associated NDVI cluster
  df_BN1 <- df_BN0[df_BN0$NDVI == 1, ]  # Cluster 1
  df_BN2 <- df_BN0[df_BN0$NDVI == 2, ]  # Cluster 2

# Comparing density numbers in cluster 1 to those in cluster 2 
  # Using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test
    # It can be used if the data is not distributed normally
    # It requires 2 continuous variables
  wilcox.test(df_BN1$birds2, df_BN2$birds2)
  
# Result and interpretation of the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test
  # p-value = 9.965e-10; p-value < 0.05
  # W = 4.6465e+12 (the test statistic value)
  
  # Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the bird observation densities differ 
  # significantly (at a 95% confidence interval) between NDVI clusters 1 and 2. 
  # We reject the null hypothesis that both groups have similar distributions.
  # This means bird observation densities differ between urbanized areas (water, 
  # soil, most buildings, no or little vegetation) and vegetation areas (moderate 
  # to dense vegetation). It would be interesting to know if this relationship 
  # is strong or weak.

# Visualizing the data of the 2 clusters with boxplots
  boxplot(birds2 ~ NDVI2, data = df_BN0, 
          main = "Bird Observation Density for both NDVI Clusters", 
          xlab = "NDVI Cluster", 
          ylab = "Bird Density", 
          col = c("darkgrey", "lightgrey"))
  
  # The data is distributed very similarly. 
  # Both clusters have similar medians and interguartile range.
  # There are MANY outliers (thick black line above the boxes), expected with a 
    # skewed distribution.
  # There might be a statistically significant correlation, but it seams very weak 
    # as we can't visualize it. We should try and measure the strength of this 
    # significant relationship.

# Testing for correlation with the Spearman's Rank Correlation
  # It does not require normality, works well with heavy-tailed skewed distributions
  # It works with categorical variables (NDVI clusters)
  # It can measure the strength of a significant relationship between categories
  cor.test(df_BN$birds2, df_BN$NDVI, method = "spearman")
  
# Result of the Spearman Rank Correlation interpretation
  # p-value = 9.964e-10 (<0.05)
  # Spearman's rho = 0.002463804
  
  # The p-value indicates there is a statistically significant correlation (at 
  # 95% confidence interval) between the bird observation densities 
  # and the NDVI clusters, as expected. The rho values is very close to 0 which shows 
  # that the relationship is weak. This might be explained by such a large dataset, 
  # with which it might be more probable to observe a significant correlation that 
  # is not strong or meaningful practically.

# Final conclusion
  # There is a weak relationship between bird observations densities from GBIF 
  # users and urbanized areas VS moderate to dense vegetation.
  
  # It might be interesting to observe that relationship at a more close-up scale 
  # of NDVI clusters as the relationship might be "blurred", lacking details, by the 
  # resolution of the satellite image of Montreal which is quite wide. This map had 
  # pixels of about 14.5m square.
  
  # It might be interesting to test the relationship at multiple different 
  # urbanized areas in the world and see if there is consistency across them.
